# Wilsons and Related - Fantasy Football Rulebook
# League Dates
## Explanations
- **Start of League Year** - The day that transactions are eligible to be carried out again, waivers in accordance to the [[#Offseason Waiver Order]] until the Start of Season date has passed
- **Draft Start** - The beginning of the draft (see [Draft](#draft))
- **Taxi Squad and Roster Size Lock** - The day that all players on your taxi squad must meet [eligibility requirements](#taxi-squad), and your roster must be at the [correct size and composition](#base-roster). This can be extended in exceptional cases by communicating with the Commissioner, which might result in scoring adjustments on a case-by-case basis.
- **Start of Season** - The start of the NFL regular season. This is also the due date for [[#Dues and Prizes|Dues]] (required) and the [Yearly Survey](#yearly-survey) (optional, but strongly encouraged)
- **Trade Deadline** - The date that trading is disabled for the season (see [[#Trades]])
- **Start of Playoffs** - The date that the playoffs begin (see [[#Playoffs]])
- **Championship Awarded** - The date when we get a new league champion! (see [[#Playoffs]])
- **End of League Year** - The day that transactions are disabled until the start of the next league year.

# Roster Construction
## Base Roster
- Each starting lineup consists of:
	- 1 QB
	- 2 RB
	- 3 WR
	- 1 TE
	- 2 Flex (any of WR/RB/TE)
- In addition to these 9 starters, you may carry 11 players at any offensive position (excluding kickers) on your bench
- At this time, defensive stats and plays for players are not eligible for points.
## Taxi Squad
- In addition to the above base roster, each team has 5 taxi squad roster slots that can belong to any offensive position (excluding kickers) who meet the following eligibility rules:
	- Players with more than 2 years of NFL experience (entering into their 3rd NFL season) are ineligible
	- Players are taxi eligible until the start of their 3rd NFL season. Seasons accrue regardless of games played.
		- Any players with a 0 or a 1 on their player card at [[#League Dates|Start of League Year]] are eligible, these numbers update sometime in the offseason
## Injured Reserve
- Each team has 3 injured reserve slots that players can be placed into if they are on IR, have COVID-19, are suspended, are DNR, or are holding-out.
- Once a player in IR has their status change out of one of the eligible statuses (e.g. they are re-activated), you must either place them into your active roster or cut them.
## Invalid Rosters
- Rosters are allowed to be "invalid," as in having too many players, players in IR who have an IR-ineligible status (or in the offseason, players in taxi who are not eligible). 
- This is intentional, **but** you will not be able to change your starting roster or make any roster moves that aren't immediately rectifying the problem while in invalid state. Scoring is unaffected if your roster is invalid.
# Draft
## Pick Trading
- See [[#Trades]]
## Format
- The draft is a so-called "slow draft" and is conducted completely via the Sleeper app. 
- The draft consists of **3 rounds with 10 picks per round.** All players selected in the draft must be NFL rookie offensive position players (excluding kickers)
## Order
- Draft order is determined by the previous season's [[#Toilet Bowl]] results and then season standings.

| Draft Position | Awarded To                                                              | 2025-2026 Owner          |

| 10th           | Previous Season's Champion (1st Place Playoffs Finisher)                | RJ (@CMCtothemoon)       |
- Draft order remains static between rounds and does not snake. 
## Pick Timing
- Each pick is to be selected in an 8 hour time period beginning upon the completion of the pick previous to yours
- The "clock" for picking is paused from 12 AM MDT to 8 AM MDT for sleeping
- The goal of the commissioner and the league at large is to avoid missed/CPU picks to the largest degree possible. In the event that someone is non-responsive for their next pick for 48 hours (or shorter if it will potentially impact the draft overlapping the [[#League Dates|Start of Season]]), a [[#In-Season Votes|vote]] will be put to all owners to determine how to proceed.
# Waivers
## In-Season Waivers
- **Order:** In-Season (between Start of Season and Championship Awarded dates) waiver order is calculated in **reverse-standings** order, with the last place team in standings being the highest in waiver claims order.
- **How claims are calculated:** At 12:05 AM PST on each Wednesday (according to [Sleeper](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/3978868-waivers-for-regular-season-playoffs)) waivers will be processed according to the [[#How Waiver Claims Are Calculated|Sleeper waiver calculation process]]
## Offseason Waiver Order
- **Order:** Offseason (between Championship Awarded and End of League Year dates and again between Start of League Year and Start of Season dates) waiver order is calculated identically to the [[#Order|Draft Order]]
- **How claims are calculated:** At 12:05 AM PST on each Wednesday (according to [Sleeper](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/3978868-waivers-for-regular-season-playoffs)) waivers will be processed according to the [[#How Waiver Claims Are Calculated|Sleeper waiver calculation process]]
## How Waiver Claims Are Calculated
- The highest waiver claim (e.g. the person who put in a claim who is the lowest in the standings) gets their first waiver pick
- The next highest waiver claim gets their first waiver pick, and so on, until claims are all completed with the following caveat:
	- After each successful waiver pick, the priority for that owner drops to **last place.** This ensures that the last place team does not get to select all the players they want
- **Example:**
	- **Fred** is in last in the standings, puts in a claim for Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and Tom Brady (in that order)
	- **George** is second-last and puts in a claim for Jerry Rice, Tom Brady, and Brett Favre (in that order)
	- **John** is in third last and puts in a claim for Brett Favre
	- Waivers are awarded as follows:
		- **Fred** - Joe Montana (then Fred drops to the bottom)
		- **George** - Jerry Rice (then George drops to the bottom)
		- **John** - Brett Favre (then John drops to the bottom)
		- **Fred** - Tom Brady
# Trades
- Trades are as "wide open" as possible, with very minor balance provisions
- You can trade draft picks up to 3 years in advance. Your next year's picks will be added automatically in the offseason (between End of League Year and the next Beginning of League Year)
- All trades are subject to commissioner approval, but commissioner approval will happen by default unless:
	- A trade is thought to be purposefully unbalanced and a player is thought to be considering leaving the league
- In such cases, the commissioner will do the following:
	- DM the parties involved in the trade and ask about it
	- If the commissioner still feels that this trade is purposefully unbalanced, he can request that the owners pay dues for next year in advance of processing the trade (to discourage someone scrapping their roster and walking away)
- If any actions are taken by the commissioner that will result in the trade not being processed, the commissioner must abide by the terms set in [[#Commissioner Transparency]].
# Playoffs
## Participants
- Playoffs start according to the date defined in [[#League Dates]] and are comprised of the teams that finish in the top 6 in regular season standings
- Tiebreakers are the Sleeper default **Points For**, and then **Higher Points Against** if the standings order is somehow still tied (see [Sleeper article](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/5200797-how-do-tiebreakers-wor))
## Format
- Each playoff round is a single-elimination head to head matchup with the winner advancing.
- The top two regular season finishers get a bye on the first week of playoffs, and matchups are determined via a "best gets to play worst" system (3 vs. 6, 4 vs. 5)
- In the next week, the two advancing teams play the top two teams in a "best vs. worst" fashion again
- Finally, the championship round is the third week of playoffs with the final two teams playing one another.
## Waivers
- Waivers and all roster moves (excluding trades) are allowed during the playoffs.
# Toilet Bowl
## Participants
- The Toilet Bowl starts the same week as the playoffs (as defined by the date in [[#League Dates]]) and are comprised of the 4 teams who do not qualify for the [[#Participants|Playoffs]].
- Tiebreakers are the Sleeper default **Points For**, and then **Higher Points Against** if the standings order is somehow still tied (see [Sleeper article](https://support.sleeper.com/en/articles/5200797-how-do-tiebreakers-wor))
## Format
- Each Toilet Bowl round is a single-elimination head to head matchup with the winner advancing.
- The winner of the Toilet Bowl wins the highest [[#Order|draft order]], with second, third, and fourth place winning the remaining high draft order positions.
	- You want to **win** in the Toilet Bowl, not lose. Winning the Toilet Bowl is some level of prestige, losing is the ultimate shame.
## Waivers
- Waivers and all roster moves (excluding trades) are allowed during the Toilet Bowl.
# Rule Changes
Rule changes occur in one of two ways:
- The [[#Yearly Survey]], sent to all league members to vote on rule changes
- A successful [[#In-Season Votes|In-Season Vote]] that has **unanimous** participation, and a minimum of 90% affirmative responses. As such, these are only to be used in emergency cases
## Suggesting new rules
- Right now, rules are suggested by DMs to the commissioner. There will eventually be a way to do this anonymously, but there isn't at this time. 
	- All rule suggestions will be added to the survey.
- If a rule loses in the survey, it cannot be re-proposed right away. If it loses, a 1 year period must pass before it can be re-proposed to reduce the survey being the same rules continuously suggested.
	- If a rule fails its second attempt, it is permanently removed from consideration. To re-introduce it, it must have a majority of people [[#In-Season Votes|vote]] for it to be re-added to the survey. 
## Rule Corrections
- If something is incorrect in this document, and represents a rule to be added that is not a material change (but either a mistake in writing or a misunderstanding), it can be suggested to be added/changed by anyone and put into the document without following the normal process, as long as [[#Commissioner Transparency]] is upheld.
# Yearly Survey
- The yearly survey is anonymous, and will be sent out before the Start of League Year.
- Participation in the survey is optional, but any content contained in the survey will pass with a simple majority, so participation is strongly encouraged.
# Casual Votes
- Casual votes regarding trade vetos, scoring disputes, minor process changes that don't rise to the level of rule changes (e.g. changing dates for the draft), or any and all player/roster disputes will be passed by a simple majority, and can be conducted via the Sleeper chat. 
- These votes will be anonymous where it makes sense and is possible for them to be made anonymous.
# Owner Leaving the League and Expansion
## Owners Leaving the League
- Any owner leaving the league should preferably let the commissioner know they are leaving before [[#League Dates|Start of League Year]], but you can leave at any time
- If the owner leaves before [[#League Dates|Start of League Year]], they will not be subject to [[#Dues and Prizes|Dues]], but if it is made past that point, they will be expected to pay for the final year.
- Owners are discouraged from conducting non-competitive [[#Trades|trades]] prior to leaving, as any non-competitive moves would place the new owner at a competitive disadvantage.
- Any actions deemed to be non-competitive in the light of an owner leaving will be [[#Casual Votes|voted on]] and potentially reversed to keep the new owner from having to deal with a non-competitive roster.
## Expansion
- Expansion to 12 teams is possible and welcomed. If anyone has potential names for expansion, please contact the commissioner.
- Any rules for an expansion draft would be voted on in the [[#Yearly Survey]], were it ever to happen.
# Commissioner Transparency
- Any and every commissioner action that utilizes commissioner permissions (e.g. anything a non-commissioner user **could not** do in the Sleeper app) **must** be reported via the open and universally available chat channel in Sleeper. There are no exceptions to this rule.
# Commissioner Mutiny
- In the event that a commissioner is to be mutinied and replaced, an anonymous vote must pass with a simple majority to remove them.
- After this passes, there will be an open vote with whoever wishes to be the commissioner next placed in as options, and the winner will be selected as the new commissioner.
- It is currently impossible to anonymously start a poll, and this will be looked into in the future to try to allow for this, were it ever to happen.

# League Dates
## Explanations
- **Start of League Year** - The day that transactions are eligible to be carried out again, waivers in accordance to the [[#Offseason Waiver Order]] until the Start of Season date has passed
- **Draft Start** - The beginning of the draft (see [Draft](#draft))
- **Taxi Squad and Roster Size Lock** - The day that all players on your taxi squad must meet [eligibility requirements](#taxi-squad), and your roster must be at the [correct size and composition](#base-roster). This can be extended in exceptional cases by communicating with the Commissioner, which might result in scoring adjustments on a case-by-case basis.
- **Start of Season** - The start of the NFL regular season. This is also the due date for [[#Dues and Prizes|Dues]] (required) and the [Yearly Survey](#yearly-survey) (optional, but strongly encouraged)
- **Trade Deadline** - The date that trading is disabled for the season (see [[#Trades]])
- **Start of Playoffs** - The date that the playoffs begin (see [[#Playoffs]])
- **Championship Awarded** - The date when we get a new league champion! (see [[#Playoffs]])
- **End of League Year** - The day that transactions are disabled until the start of the next league year.
